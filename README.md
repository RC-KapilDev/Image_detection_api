Object Detection API with FastAPI and YOLOv8n

The Object Detection API built using FastAPI and the YOLOv8n model detects objects within images sent from a Flutter application for the purpose of displaying relevant advertisements.

This API was developed for a competition where the goal was to create a system that could identify objects in user-provided images and suggest relevant advertisements based on the detected objects.

Technology Stack:

Backend: FastAPI (Python)
Machine Learning Model: YOLOv8n (Customized YOLO-based model)
